         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Their many objections, therefore, and difficulties, urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Being of any ſuch Guid, are here conſidered, and replyed to: Eſpecially thoſe occurring in the writings of their later Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, Arch Bp. <hi>Lawd,</hi> Bp. <hi>Bramhall,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Dr <hi>Ferne,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> and others. Whoſe Art and diligence hath been ſo great in fighting againſt their own Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (if I may ſo ſay), and in hindring Themſelves and others, with all imaginable arguments, from returning into the Unity of the Catholick Church, and Faith, that there ſeemes nothing left out, or neglected by them, that can hereafter be ſaid, new, in their in their Defence. Of which objections, whether any of moment, and pertinent to the matter in hand, are, here, concealed, or of thoſe mentioned any not fully ſatisfied, is left to the equal Reader's Judgment.</p>
            <p>The Author, though conſcious of his weaknes, yet confident of the Cauſe, and preſuming ſo neceſſary a Truth to have ſo much advantage over Error, as that it needeth not the very ſharpeſt wit, and exacteſt Judgment, to vindicate and maintain it, hath taken in hand this task, (in the long ſilence of many other more able Workmen), that he might give ſatisfaction to ſome perſons, who ſeem, with great indifferency, to deſire it; and that the Adverſary, in having the <hi>laſt Word,</hi> might not alſo, to ſome weaker judgments, ſeem to have the <hi>beſt Cauſe.</hi> And, to this end, He hath alſo wholly applyed himſelf, herein, to the <hi>language</hi> and <hi>expreſsions</hi> of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> uſed in this Controverſie; and indeavored to follow their Motion to the ſmaleſt Particulars, and laſt Retraits; and hath built a good part of his diſcourſe on their own Conceſſions (as more prevalent with ſuch Readers), and thoſe materials, which their own writings afford, advantagious to Truth, and the preſent deſign.</p>
            <p>Recommending this moſt important affair to the Proteſtant Readers moſt ſerious conſideration. As which, if what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed here be made good, will poſſeſs Him of a much more true, and ſolid Satisfaction, and Tranquility of minde, than his former Principles could poſſibly afford Him: 1 * Whilſt now he diſcernes himſelf, (contrary to what he, before, imagined), guarded, in his way to heaven, with a <hi>double Guide</hi> unfailable: <hi>The Holy Scriptures,</hi> as what points they are <hi>clear:</hi> And next, the <hi>Holy Church,</hi> in what they ſeem <hi>obſcure;</hi> into whoſe judgment, and ſentence, he ſafely reſolves all his former Scruples and anxieties concerning

But now, thus undeceived, in the laſt place he receives yet more contentment to ſee, that <hi>Church,</hi> ſpread over all <hi>Nations,</hi> and once the <hi>Spouſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not, ſince, to be (as he formerly fancied) for many Generations, miſerably apoſtatized from her primitive faith, and purity, and ſtained with a manifold <hi>Idolatry,</hi> (whilſt the Great <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſitteth in her cheif <hi>Chair,</hi> and giveth her lawes); poiſoning the Nations with her groſs errors, and daily making more of them to drink of the <hi>wine</hi> of her <hi>Abominations,</hi> and her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo drunk with the <hi>blood</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> (for ſuch things his <hi>Teachers</hi> once made him believe);<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Apocal.</hi> 2.1.</note> But this Church to be a <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation abiding ſure,</hi> and the <hi>Pillar of Truth,</hi> for ever; Our <hi>Lord</hi> walking ſtill amongſt her <hi>Candleſticks,</hi> and holding her <hi>Stars</hi> in his hand; and by them from age to age enlightening the dark pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the world; <hi>Internal,</hi> and <hi>External</hi> Sanctity, <hi>Corporal,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> mortifications, accompanying one another, and growing together to an Angel-like purity in her <hi>Saints,</hi> and thoſe, who order their actions according to her moſt excellent Doctrines, and Councils of Perfection. In the lives of which <hi>Perſons</hi> (found in all later ages a moſt exact pattern of the former) he now examines the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of this <hi>Church,</hi> and not in thoſe others (whoſe crimes in every age are by the Church's Adverſaries curiouſly ſought out, and divulged, to ſhew, that moſt ſcandalous perſons have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the Roman Faith, (as, who was ever ſo wicked, as one of our <hi>Lord's Diſciples</hi>) Whom he now diſcernes to have departed no further from <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> than they alſo did from her <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</hi> and well perceives, that a continued purity of the Church's doctrine is, more rationally, collected from the Sanctity of the one,
<pb facs="tcp:179284:5"/>than a Corruption therein, from the viciouſneſs of the other; becauſe it may rather be preſumed, that the wicked ſhould tranſgreſs the Churches lawes, than the virtuous tranſcend them; and becauſe, both of <hi>Perſons,</hi> and <hi>Ages,</hi> ſome may be obſerved to have been much more impious, than others (as perhaps the 9th, or 10th age, than the 11th, or 12th); where, yet, the Churches <hi>Doctrines</hi> or <hi>Lawes</hi> are confeſſed to have ſuffered no mutation; and therefore ſuch wickedneſs not to have proceeded from their influence; and where thoſe holy men of the ſame times, who are produced to reprehend the faulty, yet are known to have continued ſtill with them in the ſame <hi>Communion,</hi> and <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>* Whilſt now, he alſo diſcernes an uniform deſcent of the Church's faith, and a true concatenation between the doctrines of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Fathers,</hi> and latter <hi>Schoolmen.</hi> and the <hi>ſentences</hi> of the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting the <hi>Theology</hi> of the other; theſe later aſcending indeed (by purſuing the neceſſary conſequents of former Principles), into the higheſt ſubtleties of this divine Science, but without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a <hi>Reformation</hi> of any thing formerly delivered, or impoſing their <hi>new</hi> diſcoveries on any ones <hi>Faith.</hi> And therefore no more now, doth he look into them, only as a <hi>Spy</hi> into the Camp of the Enemy, to diſcover the ſpecious fallacies of theſe great Wits againſt truth, and to give intelligence to his own party to beware of their Sophiſms; Or, at beſt, turnes ore their Volumes only to pick here, and there, a flower, as it were out of a Garden overrun with weeds: But, now, reads them, as a dutiful <hi>Son,</hi> or docible <hi>Schollar</hi> doth the leſſons of his <hi>Maſter,</hi> or preſcriptions of his <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> to tranſcribe, and follow their Inſtitutions, and rules, and propagate to poſterity what he learnes from them.</p>
            <p>Neither, on another hand, takes he now any more diſguſt and ſcandal at her <hi>Moral Divines,</hi> and <hi>Caſuiſts;</hi> conſidering them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their proper imployment; not as perſons converſing with <hi>Saints,</hi> and drawing up Rules of <hi>perfection;</hi> but applying themſelves to the Confeſſions of <hi>Sinners,</hi> and with as equal a ballance, as Theology affords them, weighing the culpableneſs of ſuch actions, as are brought before them, in order to exciting a due and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable Penitence and Contrition. Where he eaſily ſees, that it were an equal injuſtice in them, to aggravate, as to leſſen, faults: and to put mens Souls into falſe ſcruples, and terrors, as to leave them in falſe ſecurities. Hence are they moſtwhat buſied in ſetting forth the utmoſt bounds, which an action, not, to be <hi>perfect,</hi> or praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, but <hi>lawful</hi> or ſinleſs, is capable of: or alſo not this: but only, what bounds it muſt not paſs to be not ſinning <hi>mortally:</hi> or
<pb facs="tcp:179284:6"/>not <hi>mortally</hi> in ſuch a particular ſpecies thereof: though perhaps in ſome other it is ſo. * Which <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> he now diſcerns to be greatly wronged, when ſome ſentences of theirs, commonly ſtript alſo of ſome of the neceſſary circumſtances, are produced, as recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or encouraging an action, that is only by them declared, no ſin; or as countenancing or excuſing a ſin, that is only declared by them no ſuch crime, as excludes from Grace, and the ſtate of of Regeneration; or as calling Evil, good; when as that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is concealed by the Accuſer, upon which ſuppoſed only, and not abſolutely, they pronounce ſuch action Good, or lawful.</p>
            <p>Again, * Whilſt now, being thus eſtabliſhed in a right underſtanding of the <hi>Church,</hi> and of her Doctors, He proceeds to look upon thoſe Heterodox perſons, who from time to time have <hi>gone out</hi> of this <hi>Church,</hi> not as departing out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but out of the <hi>City of God;</hi> and that have all, till <hi>Luthers</hi> laſt defect on, after a ſhort blaze, come to nothing. And again, looks on thoſe <hi>Nations,</hi> who from time to time (even from the furtheſt Eaſt and Weſt) have <hi>entred into</hi> this <hi>Church,</hi> not as, thus, reduced only from one <hi>Idolatry</hi> to another (which he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly imagined) from the <hi>Heathen</hi> Idolatry, to the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>For if ſhe were ſo, then muſt we not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learn Fundamentals of her, but alſo learn of her what is Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, and take all for Fundamental, which ſhe delivers to be ſuch. In the performance whereof, if I knew any one Church to be infallible, I would quickly be of that Church. But good Sir, you muſt needs do us this favour, to be ſo acute; as to diſtinguiſh between, being infallible in Fundamentals, and being an infallible Guide in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals. That ſhe ſhall be always a Church infallible in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals we eaſily grant; for it comes to no more but this: that there ſhall be always a Church. But that there ſhall be always ſuch a Church, which is an infallible Guide in Fundamentals, this we deny, For this cannot be without ſetling a known infallibility in ſome one known Society of Chriſtians,</hi> (<hi>as the</hi> Greek, <hi>or the</hi> Roman, <hi>or ſome other Church</hi>) <hi>by adhering to which Guide, men might be guided to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve aright in all Fundamentals.</hi> Much what the ſame he ſaith cap. 2. §. 139. — <hi>You muſt know, there is a wide difference between, being infallible in fundamentals, and being an infallible Guide even in fundamentals. Dr.</hi> Potter <hi>ſaith, That the Church is the former: That is, there ſhall be ſome men in the world
<pb n="1" facs="tcp:179284:16"/>whilſt the world laſts, which err not in fundamentals: for otherwiſe there would be no Church. But we utterly deny the Church to be the later: for to ſay ſo, were to oblige our ſelves to find ſome certain Society of men, of whom we may be certain that they neither do, nor can err in Fundamentals, nor in declaring what is Fundamental, what is not Fundamental: and conſequently to make any Church an infallible Guide in Fundamentals, would be to make it infallible in all things, which ſhe propoſeth, and requires to be believed. And</hi> cap. 5. §. 60. — <hi>You ſuppoſe untruly, that there is any that viſible Church, I mean any viſible Church of one Denomination, which cannot err in Points Fundamental.</hi>

And that nothing hath been, or is brought in, that ſhe takes for a demonſtration to the contrary to what ſhe hath defined?

Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs theſe Divines alſo will here retreat, and make uſe of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that is mentioned before, §. 8. <hi>viz.</hi> that nothing at all, that is, or can, come into controverſie, is neceſſary to be decided.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:179284:36"/>of the whole Catholick Church to render them infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, more than the acceptation that is fore-mentioned, what muſt it be? 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>.

Or, are there any ſuch new Evidences or Demonſtrations now diſcoverable in matter of Faith, that are not as liable to be <hi>miſtaken</hi> in <hi>one</hi> Council, as in <hi>another;</hi> in a later, as in a former?

Or what Judge, in theſe matters, can promiſe ſuch Evidence, as that none, having the uſe of Reaſon, ſhall deny his Sentence? Laſtly, As to one Council's accepting of another, where can we ſtay, if we may not in the firſt? For will not this ſecond Council be rendred as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain to us for it's Definitions, and as liable to Appeals, upon other new <hi>Evidences,</hi> and <hi>Demonſtrations</hi> pretended againſt it, as the former was? For when, in it's Definition, againſt theſe <hi>falſe</hi> ones that are already examined, it corroborates the former; yet this hinders not, but that ſome <hi>other</hi> Evidences may be produced againſt it, and againſt the ſame Definition, that may be <hi>true.</hi> Or, 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Muſt it be ſuch an acceptation of the whole Catholick Church <hi>out of Council;</hi> that no perſon, or at leaſt, Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts ſuch former Council? This alſo is unreaſonable: For ſome, not only Perſons, but Churches, and theſe very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, (I mean, in compariſon of ſome other Churches, though not in reſpect of the main Body of the Catholick Profeſſion) may ſtand condemned of Hereſie, and Schiſm by ſome former Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and therefore do become uncapable of any right now, either of <hi>Voting</hi> in, or <hi>accepting</hi> of, a future Council; I mean, in ſuch a manner, as that their Vote, and acceptation, are any way ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the validity thereof.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:179284:36"/>in former <hi>tradition</hi>), yet when they are, in the number of Suffrages, much inferior, in this caſe neither their contrary Vote in the Council, nor their non-acceptation of it afterward, are of any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as to the annulling of the Acts of ſuch Councils. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe no <hi>new</hi> Tenent can be condemned by the Church; if thoſe who hold it, being a <hi>conſiderable</hi> number, will not concur, to vote, or to accept, the condemnation thereof.

               <p>For, 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. I think it is clear; that none who lived, and died in the <hi>Faith.</hi> (I mean; that, declared in her Councils) and in the <hi>Communion</hi> of the Weſtern, or <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that was before <hi>Luther</hi>'s Appearance, could endanger his Salvation, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his incurring either <hi>Hereſie,</hi> or <hi>Schiſm;</hi> becauſe then the Weſtern, or <hi>Roman</hi> Church before <hi>Luther,</hi> muſt be held Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or Schiſmatical, and ſo non-Catholick; for theſe two Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and Catholick, are contra-diſtinct.

As is clear in the Caſes of</hi> Arrius, <hi>and</hi> Pelagius. <hi>For it ſeems very reaſonable</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to judge; that, ſince the neceſſary Articles of Faith were all delivered by the Apoſtles to the Catholick Church, ſince the foundation of that Church lies in the belief of thoſe things which are neceſſary; that nothing ſhould be delivered contrary to any neceſſary Article of Faith, but the Church, by ſome</hi> evident Act, <hi>muſt declare its diſlike of it, and its reſolution thereby to adhere to that neceſſary Doctrine which was once delivered to the Saints.</hi> Thus he.

                  <note place="margin">§. 50. n. 1.</note> then neither to any <hi>ſince, Luther</hi>'s times.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:179284:41"/>of Hereſie, and Schiſm; in reſpect of what <hi>new</hi> Tenent, or Practiſe againſt ſome Fundamental point of Faith, ſince <hi>Luther</hi>'s time, is it become <hi>Heretical;</hi> when guilty of none ſuch, before? — And, in its <hi>requiring</hi> of <hi>Conformity</hi> to what <hi>new</hi> points of Faith, ſince <hi>Luther</hi>'s time, is it become <hi>Schiſmatical;</hi> ſo that one, that could lawfully yield obedience to all thoſe required before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s appearance, yet cannot to all the preſent; or ſo, that the Church before <hi>Luther</hi> might lawfully require, without hazard of Schiſm, Conformity to its whole Faith then; and not ſo the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> Church to the whole, <hi>preſent,</hi> Faith? For I hope none here will have the face to deny Conformity required, by the Weſtern Churches, before <hi>Luther</hi>'s coming, to many of the chiefeſt of thoſe points, wherein Proteſtants now refuſe it.

                  <hi>theſe</hi> we have no Collection, or Summary, drawn up by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, as we have of the <hi>other.</hi> 3 That, as theſe Proteſtants ſay, they do not, for the ſpeculative Credends, rely barely on the <hi>words</hi> of the Apoſtles Creed, or any <hi>private ſence</hi> of Scriptures; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to believe them according to the Explications made of them by the Church in her firſt four General Councils, and do place the ſecurity of their Faith, in them, not on their own judgment, but on their <hi>conformity</hi> to the judgment of theſe <hi>Councils;</hi> ſo it is all reaſon; that, for the <hi>practicalls</hi> alſo, they ſhould rely on the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, only ſo as they are explicated by the Church in her Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils. 4 That, for both theſe, (<hi>ſpeculatives,</hi> or <hi>practicals,</hi>) as they do, or ought to rely on the Explications of the <hi>first four Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils;</hi> ſo, * that they cannot rationally confine their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to theſe alone, but do owe it alſo to <hi>any</hi> Councils of the Church following, in any age whatſoever: provided, that theſe be of <hi>equal</hi> authority: To which later Councils <hi>new Hereſies</hi> may give like occaſion of further explicating the Articles of our Faith; either in <hi>ſpeculatives;</hi> or <hi>practicals;</hi> as new Hereſies did after three ot four hundred years time, to the Explications made by thoſe firſt Councils; and * that for the ſpeculative, Articles of the Apoſtles Creed, particularly that of <hi>the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt à filio,</hi> the Proteſtants have ſubmitted to the Explications of Councils, after the four firſt, (and theſe too, Weſtern Councils only, when the Greek Churches refuſed to conſent to them; and that, as the Greeks ſay, upon not a verbal, but real, diverſity in their faith, concerning this <hi>proceſſion;</hi> yet, it ſeems, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants here preferr'd, and thought fit to adhere rather to, the authority of the Weſtern Churches.) From all which, it follows; that, if the Proteſtants diſſent from the Explications of <hi>ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> held in any Age, in either of theſe, <hi>ſpeculative,</hi> or <hi>practical, Articles</hi> of their faith, that are neceſſary (of which neceſſity, it is fit alſo, the Council, not they, ſhould judge), they cannot be <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure</hi> of their retaining all <hi>neceſſary</hi> faith, ſo, as no way to have fallen from it into <hi>Hereſie,</hi> or <hi>Schiſm:</hi> no more, then they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, <hi>Arrians,</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> ſecure in their belief of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Creed, when departing from the Explications of the four firſt Councils.

But if ſuch Controverſies be ſuppoſed <hi>in non-ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries;</hi> yet, for the <hi>peace</hi> of the Church, after the determination of ſuch a Council, the adverſ party ought to acquieſce in <hi>ſilence,</hi> and <hi>non-contradicting,</hi> without either pronouncing that an Error, which ſuch Council holds a Truth; or the Scripture clear for ſuch a ſence, as ſuch Council diſallows. 13.

               <p n="1">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. The firſt Conſiderable is: Whether the <hi>neceſſary</hi> points, wherein our Lord is ſuppoſed perpetually <hi>ſo</hi> to aſſiſt his Church, or her general Councils univerſally accepted, as that ſhe is <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,</hi> and doth not err in the deciſion of them, and conſequently, whereto all her ſubjects are obliged to yield their <hi>aſſent,</hi> ought not to be extended ſo far, as to comprehend ſome at leaſt of thoſe points, (I mean, either the <hi>Negative,</hi> or <hi>Affirmative</hi> of them,) the diſputes about which, (as things of the <hi>higheſt moment</hi>) have ſo miſerably afflicted the weſtern Churches now for ſo long a time. The neceſſary conſequence of the doctrine of <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,</hi> (as many Proteſtants maintain), is the committing of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> in worſhipping a piece of bread for our Lord Chriſt. Is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:179284:47"/>not this point then neceſſary and Fundamental to Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that, in a Council meeting to decide it, the contrary to <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi> ſhould be therein determined? For the Affirmative can never be determined in ſuch a Council, where the Negative is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be believed? If the belief of Gods <hi>eſſential Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes</hi> is a neceſſary and fundamental point of faith, is not the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the contrary, and giving ſome of them to a creature, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Saint-Invocation,</hi> (a thing with which Proteſtants charge the Roman Church) erring in a <hi>Fundamental?</hi> and if it be, then cannot a General Council, univerſally accepted, ſo define. The ſame may perhaps be ſaid of many other points, Merit of works, VVorſhip of Images, Communion in one kind, according to what eſteem many Proteſtants have of theſe errors, aggravated alſo by their fancy, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Antichrist.</hi> But, ſuppoſe none of them to be in neceſſaries; yet they being affirmed by the more moderate Reformed to be-errors very <hi>grievous, damnable, &amp;c.</hi> then may not a right belief of them be thought neceſſary ſo far, as that the Catholick Church, and ſuch a Council may be preſumed to receive from our Lord a continual preſervation in a right Faith of them, if the Error in them be pretended ſo grievous? And I deſire that, for this, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s words, quoted below, §. 59. may be well weighed. As likewiſe, this to be conſidered,<note n="‖" place="margin">Of Hereſie, §. 13.</note> whether it is not all reaſon, that the Church, or theſe Councils, not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, or Inferiors, ſhould judge of this <hi>Neceſſity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. If this may not be granted;<note place="margin">§. 56. n. 4.</note> that any of theſe <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern</hi> Controverſies are about <hi>Neceſſaries;</hi> or the points ſuch,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that the Church Catholick, or her General Councils, univerſally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, in their Definitions, cannot err in them; and ſo an <hi>aſſent</hi> to ſuch Definitions be due from her Subjects. The Second Conſiderable is: VVhether at leaſt, when ſuch Councils define them, all particular, <hi>Perſons,</hi> and <hi>Churches,</hi> ought not to yield the external Obedience, to them, of <hi>Silence,</hi> and not any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>oppoſing,</hi> or contradiction; without theſe private men's, or alſo Church's, reſerving ſtill to themſelves, (leſt ſome <hi>Truth</hi> ſhould be thus oppreſſed), new <hi>Remonstrances,</hi> and Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and a <hi>Liberty,</hi> (if upon theſe Remonſtrances the Church Catholick neglect to aſſemble another Council, or, it called, err again in the reſult,) a <hi>Liberty</hi> I ſay (eſpecially if it be a Church <hi>National</hi>) to <hi>reform,</hi> for themſelves, ſuch <hi>Errors</hi> of Councils. For, with ſuch Reſervations, what ſignifie their former appeals to, or to what purpoſe, any Meeting of, ſuch Councils? when as 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. The preſent Controverſies are not allowed to be in <hi>Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:179284:48"/>(in all which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and Reformed are ſaid by them to be already fully agreed); 2 And then, they will yield nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any <hi>internal,</hi> nor <hi>external</hi> Obedience to any ſuch <hi>Conciliary</hi> Decrees in the ſtating of <hi>non-neceſſaries?</hi> But, if ſuch an external ſubmiſſion of <hi>non-contradiction</hi> be thought fit to be allowed, though that internal of <hi>aſſent</hi> cannot be obtained, yet this ſeems to ſecure the Church's peace: for thus a Controverſie, once defined can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be revived, to the diſturbance thereof; and if they ſay, ſome Truth ſomtime may happen thus to ſuffer; yet, being in a non-ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, (as they ſay it is) it may be ſpared; Neither, had this Duty been duly performed by our Anceſtors, do I ſee, how the paſt <hi>Reformation,</hi> as to many points, could have found any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. And therefore, though ſome of the formerly recited ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals of Proteſtants promiſe fairly for ſuch an <hi>abſolute</hi> ſubmiſſion to Councils; yet the Archbiſhop ſeems to allow no more than a <hi>conditional</hi> one, and with an, <hi>If,</hi> or <hi>

The Council diſmiſſed, he finds yet other <hi>new Reaſons,</hi> or a <hi>greater ſtrength</hi> in his former; and falls again to the abetting, maintaining, and ſpreading abroad his old Doctrine. A Fourth Council, upon thoſe new Troubles of the Church, 1059. Four years after the laſt, was called at <hi>Rome;</hi> where himſelf alſo was preſent; ſome ſay, long Diſputation there had; his <hi>new</hi> Plea for it found too light, and rejected, and his Opinion oppoſing Subſtantial Converſion, again condemned, both by himſelf, and by the Council, conſiſting of 103.

How happened it then, that heretofore, ſo many, (learned, unlearned), when forſaking the <hi>Church's</hi> guidance, erred in them?

Neither can the Doctor's meaning here be; that one indeed may not ſeparate, but yet may by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication be ſeparated, for his non-conforming, in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to the Church-Catholick, without Schiſm.

               <p n="1">1.

                  </gap>cure of its not erring: Becauſe here the promiſe of not erring may poſſibly be verified only in the ſmall diſſenting party. See Doctor <hi>Hamond</hi> of Hereſie, <hi>p.</hi> 156. <hi>n.</hi> 6. where he ſaith, <hi>That the promiſe of the Gates of Hell not prevailing againſt the Church, can no way belong to a Council unleſs all the Members of the Church were met together in that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:179284:101"/>Council; for if there be any left out, why</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>may not the promiſe be good in them, though the Gates of Hell ſhould be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to prevail againſt the Council.?</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">See <hi>Chilling.</hi> c. 2. p. 139.— <hi>Stillingf.</hi> pag. 251.</note> And what he ſaith of the Council, holds as much in the acceptation of it, where ſome refuſe this. So therefore, none can give faith to the definition (concerning <hi>Chriſts Godhead</hi>) of the Fathers in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> upon our Lords promiſe of the Gates of Hell not prevailing againſt his Church; if ſome few oppoſe it, (as the <hi>Arians</hi> did) for in them, not thoſe of the Council, may the Promiſe be made good. And hence, whilſt they find in former ages a <hi>Berengarius,</hi> a <hi>Wicliffe,</hi> the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> an <hi>Hus,</hi> a <hi>Luther,</hi> and ſome Followers, varying from the judgment of the Councils called in their times, they are willing to believe the Orthodox and <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> to have been preſerved in <hi>theſe</hi> few Diſſenters, and the Councils, though univerſally accepted by the reſt, to have erred from it; nor to oblige them upon the account of ſo general an approbation: and thus, even the diſſent of thoſe perſons, who have no power to vote in the Council, yet out of it, is effectual to void the obligation of the Council. So, though they uſually name the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Gallican,</hi> as well as Proteſtant Churches, as non-acceptors of the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> yet, if a ſufficient acceptation thereof, as to <hi>Proteſtant Controverſies</hi> both of the <hi>Gallican</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Churches be proved to them, nothing is gained hence for ſecuring its mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rability even in a Fundamental; becauſe the belief of all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the verifying of the Divine Promiſes, they hold may be ſufficiently conſerved in the <hi>Proteſtants ſolely</hi> ſtanding out againſt it. And, when they grant, that Councils <hi>univerſally accepted</hi> cannot err in neceſſaries; they ſay only this, That <hi>ſome or other</hi> profeſſing Chriſtianity ſhall never ſo err; and then conclude from hence, that neither doth or can the <hi>whole ſo</hi> err in thoſe things, wherein it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with them. But next; admitting an infallibility in Neceſſaries to be allowed by the more ſober and judicious Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants to a Council accepted by a <hi>much major part</hi> of the Church-Catholick; though ſome perſons, or Churches alſo, diſſent, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which nothing even in the firſt General Councils ſtands firm;) yet herein ſtill is continued a conteſt, when the number of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters is ſo great, and conſiderable, as to invalidate the ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the reſt, when not: Nor ſee I, how it can be reaſonably defided (yet a thing of greateſt conſequence) unleſs herein the minor will be content to follow the judgment of the much major part concerning what Councils ſtand thus admitted, or rejected; which rule were it obſerved, then both, in a valid acceptance of the Councils held in the Weſtern Church in latter ages, Proteſtants

Imagine we ſuch a ſecond Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil called; and this, for the lawfulneſs, and proceedings thereof, void of exception; yet can it end no controverſie any more, than the former; nor is it more free from appeals; for, ſo long as this future Council, as well as the former, is liable to errors <hi>manifeſt,</hi> and <hi>intolerable,</hi> even in neceſſaries, if it be not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally accepted; or in non-neceſſaries, though it be ſo; it followes, that ſuch errours may be by private men diſcovered; and new evidences out of the Scripture, or new demonſtration may appear againſt them; and ſo, upon the former terms, muſt be admitted a
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:179284:106"/>new complaint, and a new appeal to <hi>another</hi> future Council. For ſuch reſting of a former perſon in the concluſion of the Council, after his evidences heard and diſallowed, inferrs not an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence of all other perſons whatever; or yet, of the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whenever any other evidence, or demonſtration, may appear to them, either againſt any other Definition of that Council, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt that, which others upon miſtaken grounds, queſtioned cauſleſly; for why may not one bring a true evidence, or demonſtration, againſt a point, and ſo ought to be heard; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, another, or the ſame, perſon hath brought a falſe, and ſo is ſilenced? Thus is the freeing men from the Laws of their Superiors, like the breaking out of waters, by no device af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to be ſtopped, where, or when we pleaſe. So, many evidences and demonſtrations againſt a corporeal <hi>Preſence,</hi> being long ago preſented to ſeveral Councils, &amp; rejected as falſe, yet ſtill new ones (or indeed the ſame) are pretended, to keep the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie on foot, and bring it to another trial, where the Judge may be better informed.</p>

                  <hi>how it ſhould be known, when errors are manifeſt, and intolerable, and when not? We here appeal to Scripture interpreted by the concurrent ſence of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, the common reaſon of mankind, (ſuppoſing the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be the Rule of Faith); the conſent of wiſe, and learned men; which certainly will prevent the exorbitances, and capricious humours of fantaſtical ſpirits which may cry out; That the moſt received Truths, ever ſince Chriſtianity was in the world, are intolerable errors. If you are reſolved farther to ask; Who ſhall be judge, what neceſſary reaſon, or demonſtration is? His Lordſhip tells you, I think plain enough from</hi> Hooker, <hi>what is underſtood by it;</hi> viz. <hi>ſuch, as being propoſed to any man, and underſtood, the mind cannot chuſe but inwardly aſſent unto it. And do you require any other Judge, but a mans own judgement, and reaſon, in this caſe? But you ſay; Others call their Arguments De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations: But, let them ſubmit to this way of tryal, and they may ſoon be convinced, that they are not: Still you ſay; They will not be convinced, but will break the peace of the Church; ſuppoſing, they have ſufficient evidence for what they do. But, if men will be unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who can help it?</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet:</hi> I have ſet the place down at large, that you may better conſider, what it amounts to. Here then: you ſee, he reſtrains this <hi>particular perſon's,</hi> or <hi>Church's</hi> judgment of the <hi>intolerableneſs</hi> of ſuch Councils error ſo, That this judgment be guided, or made, <hi rend="sup">1</hi> According to the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Scripture, by the concurrent ſence of the Primitive

And again; as if the concurrent ſence of the Primitive Church did either; for what is found to be generally held by it, or what is found not to be ſo, condemned by it, (according to the Proteſtants, or Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet's</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) certainly clear any thing from being an intolerable error; when as they hold, ſuch <hi>concurrent ſence</hi> may err in <hi>Non-funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals:</hi> and again hold, that, amongſt theſe not Fundamentals, may be <hi>intolerable</hi>-errors. See before, §. 25. Next, as if (for the 2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi>) General Councils did not uſe the ſame common Reaſon of mankind, and the ſame Rule of Faith, as a private man doth, for diſcerning errors: Or, as if he, by his <hi>common Reaſon</hi> Paramount, could diſcern, where their <hi>common Reaſon</hi> miſtakes; and that, <hi>manifeſtly,</hi> and <hi>intolerably.</hi> Or, as if (for the 3<hi rend="sup">d.</hi>) in theſe Councils were not a conſent of wiſe, and learned men: Or, he knew other men more learned, than they; or knew learned men better, than they.</p>

Therefore, here it will not be enough for any, to ſay this; but they are in all reaſon to ſhew ſome Evidence or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration; that theſe 3. or any of them, are for them. And then, the ſame Queſtion returns again on Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> who ſhall judge of this pretended <hi>Evidence</hi> or <hi>Demonſtration</hi> of theirs? And he, both takes notice of it here, and anſwers it (if I underſtand Him aright) thus, That that man's own Reaſon, that pretends them, is alſo to be judge of them. For, if a <hi>Demonſtration</hi> be ſuch, as being propoſed to any man, and underſtood, the mind cannot chuſe, but inwardly aſſent to it, then his mind alſo, that propoſeth it, is thus convinced by it, and ſo knows it to be a Demonſtration. And—<hi>Do you require</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>any other Judge, but a Man's own Judgment and Reaſon, in this caſe?</hi> But ſuch collection is very faulty: Becauſe if it be true, that Demonſtrations ſuch as

But, to warrant any thing a right Demonſtration (according to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Definition of it), not one, but all mens Reaſons, that hear it, muſt aſſent to it; and then, amongſt theſe, the reaſon alſo of our Superiors; and then, any one mans reaſon, as to a Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is ſufficiently diſproved, whenever all other reaſonable men, to whom it is related, judge not the ſame with him. But, if <hi>ſome mens</hi> reaſon, when at any time oppoſing the <hi>more common,</hi> may be pretended a ſufficient judge of Demonſtrations: Then we ſtick ſtill at our former Queſtion, How will this prevent the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, and capricious humours of phantaſtical Spirits? And how will not ſome break the peace of the Church ſtill, ſuppoſing that they have ſufficient evidence for what they ſay, when they have not? Therefore, after many windings, his utmoſt anſwer is. — <hi>If men will be unreaſonable, who can help it?</hi> And ſo Mr. <hi>Chillingw</hi>

               <p>Again, thus Can. 5.—<hi>Whoſoever ſhall hereafter affirm, that any of the</hi> 39. <hi>Articles agreed upon by the whole</hi> Clergy <hi>in the Convocation held</hi> 1562. <hi>for the avoiding diverſities of opinions, and for the eſtabliſhing of conſent, touching true Religion, are in any part erroneous, or ſuch, as he may not with a good Conſcience ſubſcribe unto, let him be Excommunicated</hi> ipſo facto, <hi>and not reſtored, but after his Repentance, and publick revocation of ſuch his wicked errours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which may be added * the title Prefixed to the 39. Articles, which ſaith; <hi>that theſe Articles were drawn up for the avoiding diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of opinions, &amp; for the eſtabliſhing of conſent touching true Religion.</hi> And * thoſe words, in the <hi>Preface</hi> to the ſame Articles, <hi>Requiring all the Subjects of this</hi> Church <hi>to continue in the uniforme profeſſion thereof, and prohibiting the leſt difference from the ſaid</hi> Articles.</p>
               <p>Here then 1<hi rend="sup">ſt.</hi> the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the Title, and the 5<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Canon, declares, that theſe Articles were drawn up for the avoiding of <hi>diverſities</hi> of <hi>opinions,</hi> and for the <hi>eſtabliſhing of Conſent.</hi> But, how doth the drawing-up, or alſo the impoſing, of theſe Articles, effect the avoiding diverſities of opinions, if the Church by this act layes no reſtraint at all upon <hi>opinions,</hi> nor the Subſcription required to them, imply any <hi>aſſent</hi> to, or belief of them? or, how effect the eſtabliſhing of conſent, if all the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the Church requires to them be only a <hi>non-contradiction?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Again; here (in the preface to the Articles) not only ſilence, and non-renouncing, but <hi>profeſſing,</hi> of them is required; but none are tied to profeſs any thing, but what they alſo are tied either to believe; or to profeſs, though againſt their Conſcience. 3. Again: In the 5<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Canon, the words—<hi>Erroneous, or ſuch, as he may not with a good Conſcience ſubſcribe;</hi> do imply, that he cannot with a good Conſcience ſubſcribe to them, who thinks them erroneous; but any may ſubſcribe to them with a good conſcience, though they be erroneous, if the ſubſcription only oblige to <hi>non-contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> for none are bound <hi>in conſcience</hi> to contradict every thing, that they hold an errour 4<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> Here (in the 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> and 5<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non) the Church of <hi>England</hi> Excommunicates them, that affirme
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:179284:130"/>ſuch, and ſuch things, not, till they repent of, and publickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke their unpeaceful, or turbulent <hi>contradiction</hi> of her decree, but till they repent of, and revoke their <hi>wicked errours:</hi> and ſee <hi>Can</hi> 12 revoke their <hi>Anabaptiſtical errours;</hi> where [<hi>Annabaptiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> joyned to Errour clearly applies the word [Errour] not to the act of contradicting, but to the matter, wherein ſuch a one contradicts. Now Excommunication here, till one revokes his Errours, is till one changeth, or at leaſt profeſſeth, that he chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his opinion; for one may revoke, or Repent of his <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> who doth not at all of his <hi>Errours;</hi> which contradiction is not an Errour of the underſtanding, but a fault of manners; which alſo we eaſily rectifie, without repenting of or revoking any former opinion, and conſequently without revoking our Errour. But here the Excommunication extends to this latter. Where if, by any ones publickly revoking his wicked Errours, be meant only the revoking of the divulging of his wicked Errour, then would ſuch a recantation as this, be ſufficient to reſtore ſuch an excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated perſon to the Churche<hi>'s</hi> Communion; <hi>I hold indeed my former tenent ſtill, but heartily repend, and am ſorry, that I have divulged it; nor will I, for the future, do the like.</hi> But ſuch reconciliative recantations we know are never accepted amongſt the Reformed, unleſs ſuch perſons condemn alſo their former Doctrines as falſe; and acknowledge for true, and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox thoſe of the Church. Again: In this matter I aske; If any one, when required by the Church to declare his opinion, doth affirm ſuch a wicked Errour, to the affirmers whereof the Church hath denounced Excommunication (for Example, affirms the <hi>King</hi> not to be Supreme in Eccleſiaſtical matters, againſt the 2d. Canon) whether is he not, in ſuch a caſe, by that Canon liable to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication? If he be, them it is not, becauſe he declareth what he holdeth (for, how can the Church Excommunicate him for doing that, which ſhe requireth of him; <hi>i. e.</hi> for declaring what he holdeth, upon her interrogation)? but, becauſe he hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that which he ought not; <hi>(i. e.)</hi> for his opinion, for his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Errour; as ſhe there calls it. And doth not the Church of <hi>England</hi> likewiſe allow of the <hi>King</hi>'s requiring, in the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, touching this point, not only a non-affirmation of the contrary, or a non-contradicting of ſuch a truth; but a <hi>ſincere acknowledgment in his conſcience,</hi> and a believing of it: <hi>I do utterly teſtify and declare in my conſcience</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So alſo the Parliament 13 <hi>Elizab.</hi> 12. requireth: <hi>That every one, that hath an Eccleſiaſtical living,</hi> declare his aſſent, <hi>and ſubſcribe to the</hi> 39. <hi>Articles of Religion</hi>—<hi>And that no perſon be admitted to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:179284:130"/>any Benefice with cure, except he ſhall firſt have ſubſcribed the ſame Articles, with declaration of his</hi> unfeigned aſſent <hi>in the ſame.</hi> [Here you ſee the ſubſcription interpreted aſſent] Now, will the <hi>Church</hi> deny the lawfulneſs of the Act of the <hi>State,</hi> paſſed by the Lords <hi>Spiritual,</hi> as well as <hi>Temporal:</hi> Or, may not a Church, though fallible, enjoyn, or require as much acknowledgement, as much aſſent in a matter of Faith, as the ſaid Church allows a fallible King, or Parliament, to do?</p>
               <p>But ſee Canon 36. Of the ſame Synod, 1603. where the Church alſo requires the Subſcribers, not only, not to affirm the 3. Articles, contained in that Canon, to be erroneous. Namely, <hi>That the Kings Majeſty, is the only Supreme Governour of his Realm in ſpiritual things.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Book of Common prayer containeth in it nothing contrary to the Word of God</hi> &amp;c. But in the third Article, (more expreſly) requires him to ſubſcribe <hi>That he alloweth, and acknowledgeth,</hi> [(i.e.) confeſſeth, believeth] <hi>all the</hi> 39. <hi>Articles to be agreeable to the word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Add to this; <hi>That, whereas the Canon</hi> 140. <hi>excomminicates, (till they publickly revoke their wicked error) any, who ſhall affirm; that thoſe, who had not given their voices to the decrees made in the Sacred Synod of this Nation, are not ſubject to the decrees thereof;</hi> and therefore, in the conference at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> the Puritan Party moved this queſtion; <hi>how far</hi> ſuch Ordinances of the Church were to bind them, without impeaching their Chriſtian liberty? They received from the King this anſwer: <hi>I will have one Doctrine, and Diſcipline, one Religion in Subſtance, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and therefore I charge you never to ſpeak more to that point; How far you are bound to obey? When the Church hath ordained it.</hi> This Injunction of King <hi>James</hi> to Puritans, had it been obeyed by the firſt Reformers, would it not have prevented the birth of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantiſme, and the diſpute at <hi>Hampton-Court?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again; the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 83. n. 2.</note> in ſome of thoſe Canons, excommunicates men for not doing ſomething, which ſhe <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth</hi> to be <hi>done;</hi> now in all ſuch in junctions of Practicals, there is involved an injunction of <hi>aſſent</hi> fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt, that ſuch practiſes are <hi>lawful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ninth Canon runs thus; <hi>Whoſoever ſhall hereafter ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate themſelves from the Communion,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>in the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; — <hi>accounting the Chriſtians, who are conformable to her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to be profane, and unmeet for them to joyn with, in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Profeſſion; let them be excommunicated</hi> ipſo facto, <hi>and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, till after their repentance, and publick Revocation, of ſuch their ſtored, till after their repentance, and publick Revocation, of ſuch their wicked errors.</hi> Here the Church of <hi>England</hi> requires
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:179284:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>under pain of Excommunication, that none do <hi>account</hi> her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion profane, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For whoſoever accounteth the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſuch, (her ſelf being judge), ought to ſeparate from her, an erronious conſcience obliging. Neither may any ſay, that the Church here, for his reſtitution, enjoyns repentance, only for his ſeparating; but rather, for his accounting thoſe, who conform, profane, (1.) for his errors, from which once granted, a ſeparation ought to follow.</p>
               <p>Again, Canon 12. <hi>Thoſe, who ſubmit themſelves to be ruled by any Eccleſiastical conſtitutions, made without the Kings authority, are excommunicated.</hi> Here the Canon requiring men not to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to be governed by ſuch conſtitutions, requires them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve alſo ſuch Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions to be unlawfully made, and not obliging; elſe men ought to ſubmit unto them.</p>
               <p>Canon 59. <hi>Thoſe Parſons, who do not teach on Sundays the Catechiſm, ſet forth in the Common-prayer Book, are excommunicated:</hi> But, if they hold any thing in ſuch Catechiſm unlawful, they may not teach it; therefore the Synod, in expreſly requiring them, under pain of Excommunication, to teach it, virtually, under the ſame penalty, requires their aſſent, that it is lawfully to be taught.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> In the National Synod,<note place="margin">§. 83. n. 3.</note> held under King <hi>Charles</hi> 1640. See the third Canon;<note place="margin">2.</note> where it is ordered—<hi>That all Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants</hi> [though ſilent, though nothing affirming, whatever way they can be diſcovered, whether by their refuſing to take the Oath of Allegiance, (which Oath, exacts their punctual aſſent to ſeveral D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctrines,); or by their refuſing to receive the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (a practice that requires their aſſent, that this Church is not Schiſmatical)], <hi>be excommunicated.</hi> Where, whilſt the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> thinks, ſhe hath ſufficient authority to exclude from her <hi>Communion,</hi> all that hold the <hi>Popiſh Tenents,</hi> why complains ſhe of the tyranny of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> in excluding from her <hi>Communion</hi> all, that hold the <hi>Proteſtant Tenents?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, in the fourth Canon it is decreed,— <hi>That any one, who is accuſed of Socinianiſm, unleſs he will abſolutely,</hi> &amp; in terminis, <hi>abjure it, be excommunicated.</hi> Now he that is required, upon pain of Excommunication, to abjure the <hi>Popiſh,</hi> or the <hi>Socinian</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, is required under the ſame penalty, ſo often, to <hi>aſſent</hi> to the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> or the <hi>Anti-Socinian,</hi> Tenents, where ever theſe are immediately contrary, or contradictory to the other, as many times they are.

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, in the ſixth Canon, there the Synod requires * <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> and approbation of the Doctrine, and Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as containing all things neceſſary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and * the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of this <hi>aſſent</hi> upon <hi>Oath.

Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if they be well conſidered, you may find; that they are both, in the Articles, pretended to be <hi>Scripture,</hi> and reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truths; and that all, or moſt of them are equivalent to affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matives; and as <hi>new,</hi> and <hi>poſitive</hi> on the one ſide, as the Roman Articles, which they contradict are pretended, on the other; and the Proteſtants Confeſſion of Faith (ſuppoſing him obliged to believe theſe Negatives) as large, and as particular on the one ſide, as the Roman, or Tridentine is on the other, as to the maine Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies that are bandied between the two Churches; and theſe not only <hi>privatively,</hi> but <hi>poſitively</hi> oppoſite. For no difference can be made in the thing (but only in the expreſſion) between a negative, and poſitive Article, where the negative implies, and is equivalent to, the affirmative of its contrary; as it is, where the contraries are <hi>immediate,</hi> and the one of them is neceſſarily put, wherever the other denied. As, God being granted a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, He that <hi>denies</hi> him to be a <hi>corporeal</hi> ſubſtance, in this he <hi>affirmes</hi> him to be a <hi>Spiritual;</hi> and ſo, thoſe that deny here ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which others affirme, in this muſt needs affirme ſomthing, which the others deny; and the negative may be (as we pleaſe) changed into another poſitive; and he who had before the poſitive, ſhall have now the negative ſide. He, that denies any Soules after this life to go into any temporal purgatory, affirms them to go into Bliſs, or Pain, Eternal; and he that affirms Purgatory, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies this; So, he that denies a <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> in the Euchariſt, affirmes the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the <hi>Symboles</hi> to remain there; and ſo <hi>e contra.</hi> Hence he that hath 39. Articles of his Faith, whereof 30. are in the expreſſion negative, 9. poſitive, hath, in matters,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:179284:135"/>wherein, the one contrary being excluded, the other is admitted (as it is in moſt of theſe Articles of Religion, that are in debate) no fewer poſitive Articles of his Faith, than he, who hath 39. expreſly poſitive; and again, he who hath 39 poſitive cannot but have 39. Negative alſo, and <hi>e contra:</hi> (only a negative confeſſion argues a former conteſt). And as <hi>Faith,</hi> ſo <hi>Hereſie,</hi> is converſant in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>And here alſo note: that it is one thing for a Church meerly to exclude from, or omit, in her Articles, or confeſſions of Faith, thoſe points, which another Church defineth: <hi>(i.e<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</hi> not to tye her Subjects to believe them; and another thing, to tye her Subjects to believe the Negatives of them, or not to believe them. Which is indeed a defining one way, as much as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church doth the other way. For Example: 'Tis one thing, not to tye her ſubjects to believe or hold, <hi>the Roman Doctrine, concerning Purgatory, Pardons, Images, Tranſubſtantiation, Invocation of Saints,</hi> &amp;c. and another thing, to tye her ſubjects to believe, or hold, <hi>that the Romiſh Doctrines concerning Purgatory,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are vainly invented, or grounded on no warrant of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God:</hi> as it is in the 22. <hi>Article</hi> Eccleſiae Anglic.

               <p>Which to make more perſpicuous:<note place="margin">§. 85. n. 3.</note> It is to be noted, that of thoſe, who ſeem in their Theological Poſitions to affirm leſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and ſo to make fewer Articles of their Faith, than ſome others do, there are two ſorts. 1. Either ſuch, as peremptorily deny the truth of thoſe additionals, which the other affirm. 2. Or ſuch, as do ſuſpend their judgement concerning ſuch additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; neither affirming, nor denying them for truths; only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying, that the others as yet do prove, or evidence them to be ſo. Now though it may be ſaid of theſe later; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they do not make ſo many Articles of Faith, or new defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the other do; and ſo alſo, that they ſeem much more ſafe, and modeſt in the <hi>paucity</hi> of their <hi>Credends;</hi> becauſe they, who neither affirm, nor deny a Tenent, cannot <hi>err</hi> in it; yet the former, who deny as far, and as peremptorily every new point, as the other affirm it, theſe can free themſelves from no curioſity, tyranny, liableneſs to errour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein they pretend the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to tranſgreſs: nor can plead any ſafety in their Doctrine, (<hi>viz.</hi> in their not erring, becauſe not <hi>determining</hi>); but do ingage
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:179284:135"/>every whit as far in ſuch points, as their adverſaries do; one in holding, and endeavouring to prove ſuch a thing a truth; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in holding, and endeavouring to prove it an error. And this is the caſe of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> which ſuſpends not her judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in thoſe new points which the <hi>Roman</hi> defines; nor denies them onely to be <hi>proved,</hi> or <hi>clear,</hi> in the Scripture: but denies them as <hi>Errors,</hi> and things <hi>contrary</hi> to Scripture: So: <hi>Purgatory, Adoration of Images and Reliques, Invocation of Saints, Indulgences,</hi> are declared repugnant to Gods Word, Art. 22. — <hi>Works of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereorgation,</hi> Art. 14. — <hi>Publick Prayer, or Miniſtery of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in a Tongue not underſtood by the People,</hi> Art. 24. — <hi>Denying of the Cup to the People,</hi> Art. 30.— <hi>Sacrifice of the Maſs,</hi> Art. 31.— <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> Art. 28. Now he that believes Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, for Example, to be contrary to Scripture, makes the contrary to Tranſubſtantiation to be Scripture, and ſo to be alſo a point of his Faith, if Scripture be ſo: and hence the Engliſh Church in obliging her Subjects to believe theſe points Errors, which the Roman Church doth hers to believe Truths, hath in his as large a Creed as the other: if the other hath <hi>Twelve</hi> new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, ſo, in her ſtating the contrary to them, hath ſhe; and is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually tyrannical (or more, becauſe the Articles of the other are the elder of the two;) the Subjects of the one having no liberty left to affirm them; as, of the other, to deny them. For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. A Subject of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (ſuppoſing him obliged to believe her Articles true) hath no more liberty left to hold Tranſubſtantiation a Truth, than a Romaniſt hath to hold it an Error: Or, (to inſtance in the implyed affirmative, that is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in oppoſition to Tranſubſtantiation on the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> ſide,) a Subject of this Church hath no more liberty left to hold the remaining of the Subſtance of the Symbols in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt an Error, than thoſe of the Roman have, to hold it a Truth. This of the firſt ſort: thoſe, who as peremptorily deny a thing, as the others affirm it. But next, you may obſerve; that neither are the later ſort, who ſuſpend their judgment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch point ſeems not proved to them, in this always the moſt ſecure, and ſafe, If the propoſers to them of that point, be ſuch perſons as they are commanded to believe, unleſs themſelves can prove the contrary to it; which is the caſe of all thoſe, who have Spiritual Superiors; and if the knowledge of ſuch a Truth be any way profitable to their Salvation; which Truths, I ſuppoſe, theſe Superiors never define, without foreſeeing, Firſt, ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, defined, beneficial to be known.

               <p>To [γ].

               <p>To [ξ]. By this it is confeſſed; that of the 39 Articles no more are Articles of the Church of <hi>England's</hi> Faith, than thoſe only, wherein <hi>Rome</hi> doth agree with her; and then, if to the reſt of her Articles, no aſſent be exacted of any, as is contended above, § 84. one, in all things <hi>believing,</hi> and being of the ſame perſwaſion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is freely admitted into the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> Communion; nay, may (without violation of her conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions) lawfully enter into her holy Orders, and Eccleſiaſtical preferments, and there remain without any engagement, to defend the Church of <hi>England's</hi> Doctrine; or teach, and inſtruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Errors.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, In what ſenſe Proteſtants ſay, theſe <hi>Negatives</hi> are no Articles of their Faith (<hi>i. e.</hi> faith neceſſary <hi>ratione medii</hi> to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) in the ſame ſenſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſaith, neither are her Poſitives, that contradict them.</p>

               <p>Thus I have made a ſearch into the obedience,<note place="margin">§. 85. n. 11.</note> which is required of her Subjects by a Church, that ſeems not well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in her authority; by reaſon that, having disjoyned herſelf from that which ſhe acknowledgeth was formerly the Catholick Church, and from Superior Councils, ſhe can neither lay claim to that <hi>Infallibility in neceſſaries,</hi> which, from our Lords perpetual ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency, reſides in the <hi>whole,</hi> (as all members, throughly conſenting with the whole, and guided by it, do lay claim to ſuch Infallibility; and therefore do require obedience from their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, in the ſame manner as the <hi>whole</hi> doth as to all ſuch doctrines, wherein they agree with the <hi>whole</hi>); nor can ſhe, ſtanding apart, and alledging the reaſon of it the former Churches errors, have the confidence to claim a new Infallibility to herſelf: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no wonder, if there ſeem ſome uncertainty, what obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhe requireth; where there is, what authority ſhe poſſeſſeth; and where ſuch obedience is grounded rather on the pretended clear evidence of the <hi>matter propoſed,</hi> than the ſoveraign, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declinable authority of the <hi>Propoſer.</hi>Meanwhile, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe challengeth an obedience of aſſent from her Subjects,<note place="margin">§. 85. n. 12.</note> or that of non-contradiction, I ſee not, how ſhe can be juſtified by the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> or by her own <hi>Principles.</hi>For, 1<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi>.

If, laying <hi>aſſent</hi> aſide, onely a <hi>non-contradiction</hi> of her Articles, or a non-affirmation that they are any way erroneous, is required, upon excommunication of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo offending; yet neither will this be juſtifiable by the Laws of the Church; for no Canon of a <hi>National</hi> Synod can juſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Excommunication on any, for affirming ſo many points in their Articles erroneous, as have been determined by Superior Councils, (a <hi>General,</hi> or a <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Synod) contrarily. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: It is not lawfull for a <hi>National</hi> Synod in <hi>England</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate a perſon for affirming their Articles erroneous in denying <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> becauſe this hath been determined affirmatively by many former <hi>Superior</hi> Synods, accepted by the whole <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church; (as is ſhewed before 1. <hi>Diſc.</hi> §. 57.) which therefore oblige Chriſtians to the belief, and profeſſion of it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Decrees of any Inferior Weſtern Synod. Neither 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Do they ſeem to inflict Excommunication on every one, that <hi>affirms</hi> any of their Articles erroneous, without condemning their <hi>own Principles;</hi> becauſe, what they ſay of General Councils, is as true, I ſuppoſe, for their own Synods: <hi>viz.</hi> That they may err <hi>groſly</hi> and <hi>manifeſtly;</hi> in which caſe, they ſay, one may <hi>lawfully affirm</hi> theſe Councils, in ſuch thing, erroneous; elſe how can they ever be corrected? (See before §. 43, 44. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) The caſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is the ſame, as to <hi>their own</hi> Synods. And then, for what, they ſay, a perſon may lawfully do, they cannot lawfully excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate him.</p>
               <p>But if it be replyed,<note place="margin">§. 85. n. 13.</note> that their Synods chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge an obedience of non contradiction onely to what they are <hi>certain</hi> is truth; and therefore none may lawfully in ſuch caſe contradict them, or affirm they err. 1<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi>.

As theirs plead certainty, ſo do other Councils; whom yet they will not excuſe, upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, for requiring aſſent, as hath been but now ſaid. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. It ſeems unreaſonable, that a certainty, either from the ſenſe of Scripture, neceſſary Deduction, former univerſal Tradition, or any other way, ſhould be pretended by a particular Church in any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, from which a major part of Chriſtianity, peruſing the ſame evidences, diſſents<note n="†" place="margin">Diſc. 2 §. 5.

               <p n="4">4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Proteſtants themſelves affirm; that thoſe, who are certain of truth, yet may not require an <hi>abſolute,</hi> but <hi>conditional,</hi> aſſent from others; who, firſt, know them in general to be fallible; and next, do not know, or have it not proved to them, that in this particular they dot err. See before, §. 85. n. 10. And the ſame they ſay for <hi>non-contradiction</hi> required; that it muſt be onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional; <hi>i. e.</hi> if the contrary truth to the error defined do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, to the Churches Subjects, neceſſary to be divulged.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, it is not denied (which was alſo but now ſaid) that particular Churches, or Provincial Synods, may be certain of ſomething as Truth, where either Scripture ſaith it, or a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary deduction collecteth it, or Tradition delivereth it, ſuch, as are <hi>Generally</hi> undiſputed and unqueſtioned: and may require from their Subjects an <hi>abſolute aſſent,</hi> and that upon Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or <hi>Anathema,</hi> to all ſuch Articles of Religion, as are either defined, or otherwiſe agreed on, by the whole Catholick Church; and that herein they have the ſame <hi>infallibility,</hi> as the Catholick; and their Subjects are, or may be, convinced, that they are the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents of the Church Catholick. As the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though otherwiſe fallible, may require, not a conditional, but an abſolute, aſſent to the Articles of the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed; becauſe ſhe in theſe is infallible, if the Catholick Church be ſo.</p>

I anſwer (for ſo much as is affirmed of ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; namely their infallibility in all their definitions made in neceſſary matters of faith:) That Proteſtants themſelves grant a ſufficient certainty, both from <hi>Scripture,</hi> and from <hi>univerſal tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that the <hi>Church Catholick</hi> of all ages is unerring in neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and that this Church Catholick alwayes doth, and ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt as well of a guiding and ruling Clergy, as a guided and ſubject Laity: And that thus far there is no controverſie, concerning
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:179284:142"/>evidence of Scripture, or Tradition. And next: from hence it certainly follows; that there ſhall be a body of Clergy for ever not erring in neceſſaries—And again, from this; that this Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, when joyned in a general aſſembly, or Council, and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly conſenting, ſhall never err in neceſſaries. And then in the laſt place, if perhaps ſome ſmaller number of them do diſſent from the reſt; ſince the Catholick Church is alwayes but one; and is a Government at peace within it ſelf; and conſtituted in a due ſubordination of its members in reſpect of one another, and alſo in reſpect of the whole; here alſo it <hi>rationally</hi> follows: that the <hi>greater,</hi> and <hi>more dignified</hi> body of this Clergy, in any <hi>diviſion</hi> of ſome members from it, muſt be, of theſe two, that Guide whom Chriſtians are obliged to follow, and the leſſer and inferior part obliged to conform to; and therefore this, of the two, the Guide unerring. See before Diſc. 2. §. 23. &amp;c.—Diſc. 1. §. 18. Here then ariſeth a ſufficient certainty in <hi>reaſon,</hi> from the principles conceded by Proteſtants, of the unerring of a lawfully <hi>general Council</hi> in <hi>neceſſaries,</hi> without ſhewing the Decree of any Council for it.</p>

Setting aſide any declaration of Scripture in this matter of infallibility; and ſuppoſing the Goſpel had not been writ: yet both the <hi>Teachers</hi> of the Goſpel for ever (in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council at leaſt) muſt have been <hi>infallible</hi> in <hi>neceſſaries:</hi> (elſe, from whom, or by what other means, no Scriptures being exſtant, could people have learnt the way to ſalvation?): And alſo, this their <hi>infallible guidance</hi> muſt have been <hi>made</hi> ſufficiently <hi>credible</hi> to the world by the tradition conſtantly deſcending from the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our <hi>Lord,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> who confirmed this their firſt teſtimony by <hi>Miracles:</hi> (elſe, the Chriſtian, would have been no rational, Religion). By which teſtimony alſo it was, that thoſe firſt Teachers, ſubſtituted by the Apoſtles, had full credit with, and did beget <hi>infallible,</hi> and ſaving <hi>faith</hi> in, their Gentile-Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, before that the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> were delivered unto theſe Gentiles; and therefore it appears, that theſe <hi>Teachers</hi> might have been alſo to this day, with ſufficient certainty, relyed on, in their propagating, and preſerving the Chriſtian faith among their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, had there been no <hi>Scriptures</hi> at all to have taught the ſame things with them; and to have born witneſs to their Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Neither may it rationally be ſaid, that the Church's poſſeſſion of theſe <hi>Scriptures</hi> hath diſinherited them of any part of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and belief, which, it is agreed, that they might have chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged, had there been no Scripture; but that the preſent Church ought ſtill, in the ſame manner, to be believed by her children to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:179284:142"/>be infallible in all neceſſary truth, as the Apoſtles were believed to be ſo by thoſe, who heard them, and only, from ſufficiently cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible witneſſes, had heard of, but had not ſeen any of, their mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. And then; ſuppoſing firſt this their infallibility in neceſſaries to be thus made credible to us by ſufficient evidence in point of reaſon<note n="†" place="margin">See <hi>Stillingf</hi> p. 559.</note>, we are to believe them alſo, when in their <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> they tell us, <hi>that they are infallible in all neceſſaries</hi> (if this be a truth neceſſary to be known) upon this account, becauſe they tell us ſo: As he, that once believes, that whatever is ſaid in Gods Word is true, is to believe alſo, <hi>that Gods Word is true,</hi> becauſe this Word ſaith ſo. Here then you ſee, that there would have been a ſufficient certainty or aſſurance to Chriſtians, deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Tradition, of their being truly and infallibly guided by the Subſtitutes of our Lord to the end of the world, without the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of any Council preſuppoſed; and had there been no holy Scriptures extant. The ſame infallible guidance therefore is now had and known ſufficiently from them, though we putting alſo the Scriptures.</p>

By primitive Tradition, the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> in her <hi>General Councils</hi> hath alwayes thought her ſelf authorized to define matters of faith upon <hi>Anathema</hi> to diſſenters; and to put them (as thought fit) in the Church's <hi>Creeds</hi> with an obligation laid on all, to believe them. Now either this will imply the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of theſe Councils (as they conceived) in ſuch points; or, if this be thought to argue ſomething leſs, let but the ſame priviledge ſtill be continued to the preſent Church Catholick in her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; and the ſame obedience yielded by her ſubjects to her preſent definitions; and a ſufficient certainty hereof granted, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſuch authority ſhe hath, and ſuch duty they owe: and any further extent of infallibility I ſuppoſe will not be claimed. Here again we ſee, that tradition in the practice of Councils, without any their Decree, ſhews a ſufficient certainty of ſuch an infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Councils, as is challenged.</p>
               <p>Thus much in anſwer to this firſt Query. Where, the taking this for a Principle of Catholicks; that none can have a ſufficient certainty of any thing (either from <hi>Scripture,</hi> or <hi>Church-Tradition,</hi> grounded at firſt on <hi>Miracles</hi>) antecedent to the Church's authority defining it in a general Council, cauſeth in ſome Proteſtants much miſarguing in this, and ſeveral other points. But now, if we return a like Query upon themſelves, who profeſs alſo a <hi>ſufficient certainty;</hi> in their faith, even of thoſe points, that are in controverſie (or it ſufficeth, if they profeſs ſo much concerning any one ſuch point); and ask, whence they have ſuch <hi>certainty?</hi> I
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:179284:143"/>ſee not, what rationally they can reply. For 1<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi>. They cannot build ſuch a certainty on any <hi>Church-authority,</hi> ſince they deny any infallibility, or ſufficient certainty as to ſuch points in the Declarations or Doctrines of this Authority, even in the ſupremeſt Collection thereof, the Councils General, preſent, or paſt.</p>
               <p>Nor yet 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. on the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> becauſe the true ſence of them, in theſe points, is not only diſputed (which is here urged by them, as ſufficient to null a certainty); but, by the much major part of Chriſtendom, and that, after the Proteſtants manifeſting to the world all the grounds of their perſuaſion, ſaid to be clear againſt their new pretenſions. But 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Since the Goſpel was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed in the world by Chriſts Subſtitutes, and Miniſters, and a multitude of ſouls ſaved thereby, before the penning, or publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> or <hi>Goſpel-Scriptures;</hi> and therefore poſſibly might in the ſame manner have continued to have been diſperſed to the end of the world; or for a much longer time then it was ſo: this Query will ſtill ſorer preſs them; what certainty, in ſuch a caſe, they (I mean the world learning their faith from <hi>Teachers,</hi> without <hi>Scripture</hi>) could have had of their faith?

               <p>I anſwer. 1<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi>. That, if what is ſuppoſed ſhould be granted, yet ſtill is ſuch Chriſtian, as believes all the Council propoſeth, ſecure, that his faith is deficient in nothing neceſſary. And, that Proteſtants think the like ſecurity ſufficient in their own faith. For they holding the ſence of Scripture clear even to the unlearned in all neceſſaries, and believing all the Scripture ſaith, though they cannot exactly diſtinguiſh neceſſary points therein from others, yet affirm their faith to be ſecure, becauſe actually not erring in any point clear, and ſo alſo, not in any point neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. That, as to the <hi>Principal</hi> points of faith called neceſſary, they are both, by Councils, ſufficiently diſcerned from non-neceſſaries; and propoſed as neceſſaries; and ſo by Chriſtians believed as ſuch: In theſe particulars, therefore, they are certain of their not erring; and, as to other points of their faith, that it is ſufficient for Chriſtians to know; that, if neceſiary, they do not err in them; though, which in particular are <hi>neceſſary,</hi> and ſo certainly not erred in, they know not. But meanwhile, do thoſe, who urge, thus, an uncertainty in the faith of Catholicks in attaching their judgment to <hi>Councils,</hi> which in <hi>not neceſſaries</hi> are ſupyoſed liable to error, make (themſelves) any better proviſion for the <hi>Proteſtants faith,</hi> in remitting them, from Councils, unto their own judgments; which, in neceſſaries alſo, they grant, are liable to error; at leaſt, upon their, not uſing due induſtry, their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſwayed by paſſion, intereſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which every humble man, ſurely, will ſuſpect himſelf of ſooner, than a Council?</p>

               <p>I anſwer: If the Council be, as it is pretended, infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, no need of correcting an error, where is none. If it be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible;

And indeed, the objection here, <hi>i. e.</hi> the ruine, which ſuch error would bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſtianity, (conſidering the obedience commanded to theſe Councils) is a ſufficient Argument, that thus they never err; nor conſequently need reformation.</p>

Again, ſince all perſons, for the truth of ſuch things wherein the ſence of Scripture is controverted, if they will not profeſs themſelves Scepticks, ought to acquieſce in ſome ultimate Judge, or other, though liable to error; let thoſe then, who reject a General Council, name what other ultimate Judge they will chuſe, rather.

In that, though ſometimes the reaſon, why theſe do not err in ſuch a Definition, may be, not their neceſſary deduction of it from an infallible Principle, but the inſpiration, illumination, immediate aſſent of faith, or ſome other way of operation of God's Spirit at that time, upon them, in ſuch manner, as it works on other Chriſtians, when ever it opens their minds, and makes them underſtand a truth beyond the rational arguments they have, or humane induſtry they uſe, to attain it: yet ſuch <hi>inſpiration</hi> in this differs from that of the Apoſtles; that, as the Council collects not this their infallibility from any unfailable argumentations, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes made by them concerning ſuch particular Concluſion; ſo neither do they collect it from any ſuch inſpiration, which they <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly</hi> p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And, to end this queſtion; let them, who ask it, conſider: in what manner the Church Catholick diffuſive is for ever preſerved infallible in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries (a thing they affirm) without its equalling infallibility Apoſtolical.

If I receive, and believe ſome part of the Canon of Scripture from clear Apoſtolical Tradition, and out of this received Canon become aſſured of Church-infallibility, afterward from this infallibility defining it, I may certainly come to know other parts of the ſame Canon that are more queſtioned. Again: when I have already learned the Church-infallibility from the Scriptures, afterward I may become, from its definitions, ſetled in the belief of all thoſe Articles of faith, wherein the expreſſions of the ſame Scriptures (though believed by me before the Churches infallibility, yet) being ambiguous in their ſence, (which ſence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and not the words, is the Divine Revelation) can beget no certain, and firm faith in me, until they are expounded by the Church infallibly relating, from God's Spirit aſſiſting it, the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſence of them to me. So that, though I believe the infallibility
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:179284:161"/>of Scripture's as well as the Church; yet, in ſo many points, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the meaning of the Scriptures is not clear to me, I receive the firmneſs of my faith in them, not from the infallibility of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures expreſſion of that which is God's Word, but of the Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding them. If then the Scripture, or Tradition-Apoſtolick, be clearer for this of Church-infallibility, than for ſome other points of faith, that perſon muſt neceſſarily be conceded to have a firmer ground of his faith for ſo many points, who believes the <hi>Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> than another, who believes only <hi>Scripture</hi> ſo; and ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alſo is preſerved in a right faith in theſe points, when the other not only may err in his <hi>Faith,</hi> but become <hi>heretical</hi> in his error, by oppoſing the definition of the Church.

That no <hi>Circle</hi> is made in a <hi>Catholicks</hi> ground or reſolution of faith, <hi>divine,</hi> or <hi>acquiſite;</hi> but that there is an <hi>ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Revelation</hi> divine (though this not neceſſary to be alwayes the ſame) whereon divine faith reſteth, and into which, and no humane motives, it reſolveth it ſelf; and an <hi>inward operation</hi> of God's <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> whereby the firmneſs of adherence of this faith to ſuch Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:179284:164"/>in particular as divine, is effected. And again, that theſe are <hi>motives</hi> from humane authority ſufficiently credible, or alſo <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally infallible;</hi> (or, as ſome of late expreſs themſelves, <hi>not-poſsibly-fallible:</hi> which if they can prove, whenas it is in the natural power of all men, even taken collectively, abſtracting here from any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſuperintendencies, to tell a lye, none have reaſon to envy any advancing of the evidences of Chriſtian Religion, or any part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: But, here, ſeems no neceſſity of pretending any other infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in theſe motives, than Catholick writers have formerly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and the adverſary alſo allows) on which an <hi>acquired,</hi> or <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> faith ſecurely reſteth; theſe motives carrying ſuch an <hi>evidence</hi> with them, as no other Religion differing from the Chriſtian, nor in Chriſtianity any Sect divided from the Catholick Communion, can upon any rational account, equall.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. That the <hi>infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> grounded on divine Revelation, and believed by a divine faith, is a main ground, and pillar of the <hi>Catholicks</hi> faith for any other Articles thereof, that are eſtabliſhed by the ſame Churches definitions, where the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> or <hi>Tradition Apoſtolick,</hi> are to him (but I ſay not the Church) doubtful. Of which ground and aſſurance of ſuch points, (believed by Catholicks from the Church's infallible authority), the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants faith is deſtitute.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. That the faith of all ſuch Articles, grounded thus on the Church's infallible authority; is (by this) grounded alſo on divine Revelation.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>[Where note: That reſolving faith into the Church's infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility (I mean, as the Church is declared thus infallible in neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by God's Word, or divine Revelation, whether written, the Scriptures, or unwritten, Tradition Apoſtolical,) or into Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Tradition, or into Scripture is in general all one, and the ſame, reſolution, <hi>i. e.</hi> into divine Revelation; and ultimately is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believing a thing, becauſe God ſaith it: <hi>ſaith it,</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; or (alſo out of them) by his Apoſtles; or by the Church ſucceeding the Apoſtles; <hi>by it,</hi> I ſay, as declared by God's Word to be alſo infallibly aſſiſted, truly to relate, and expound, what the Apoſtles, or Scripture have <hi>formerly</hi> ſaid: where ſtill the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith is into the ſame infallible Word of God delivered by theſe; and not into any proper authority, or infallibility of the deliverer; and when we ſay we reſolve our faith into the infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the preſent Church, or of the Apoſtles, we mean into Gods infallible Word delivered mediately by the one, or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by the other. And whilſt, to one that asketh me, why I believe the Scriptures, I anſwer, becauſe thoſe, who wrote them,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:179284:165"/>were aſſiſted by God's Spirit to deliver to men thoſe divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; And again, to one that asketh me, why I believe the Church, I anſwer, becauſe the Church is for ever aſſiſted by the ſame Spirit of God faithfully to <hi>relate,</hi> and <hi>expound</hi> theſe former divine Revelations delivered by thoſe who wrote the Scriptures in all neceſſary matter of faith: Here it is clear, that if one of theſe reſolutions be into divine Revelation imparted, and communicated to man by God's Spirit, ſo muſt the other; though the manner of conveying them to us by the aſſiſtance of God's Spirit, is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; as is explained before §. 109. And had the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Scriptures not been writ, (as they might have been not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten without nullifying the being of Chriſtian Religion), then all the reſolution of the Articles of our faith would have been only into the unwritten teſtimony of the Apoſtles; and from them, of the Church following them; to which Church for ever (though without any teſtimony of Scripture) the ſame promiſes muſt be ſuppoſed to have been made (for the writing of theſe Scriptures, ſurely, was no cauſe of theſe promiſes): And next, theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes might alſo have been made known to Chriſtians by Tradition Apoſtolical, related only by the Church: and conſequently the ſame credence muſt have been given to this Tradition Apoſtolical related by the Church, concerning ſuch promiſes made to it; as is now given to the Scriptures, teſtifying it.]</q>

Yet that this Church-infallibility, or that Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation which eſtabliſheth it, is not neceſſarily the firſt, or the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, divine Revelation, into which every Catholick's faith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any particular point of his belief is neceſſarily reſolved; for the divine faith of ſeveral perſons, concerning particular points, may have a various reſolution, as they come, by divers wayes, or from divers principles, to believe it; and one Article of faith may be <hi>ſavingly</hi> believed, without the preſent knowledge, or belief of another, whereon it hath dependance: as one may believe, with a divine faith, either the Scripture's, or the Church's infallibility from Apoſtolical Tradition, one before the other, as they happen to be firſt propoſed to them: (of which ſee what is ſaid before §. 128.145.) and by the certainty of his Faith grounded thereon, attain eternal ſalvation. And bleſſed be his Divine Majeſty for ſo firmly eſtabliſhing Chriſtianity one theſe two ſure Baſes, <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and <hi>the Church.</hi> For both are <hi>Pillars of Truth</hi>

This former way of communicating the people in both kinds having been changed, in both Churches, upon the ſame ground; namely the many abuſes, and irreverences, which have happened in giving the conſecrated bread into their hands, and allowing ſo many Communicants of all ages, and conditions to drink out of the Chalice.

And next, from this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed;
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:179284:189"/>firmed; that, every one may be ſo certain in all Fundamentals, it muſt be maintained alſo; that their ſpiritual Guides, in a conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, nay more, every ſingle Prelate, or Presbyter, if they are not, yet may be, an infallible Guide to the people in all Points neceſſary. And therefore Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> freely thus vindicates it<note n="†" place="margin">p. 140.</note> —<hi>That theſe alſo may be both in Fundamentals, and alſo in ſome points unfundamental, both certain of the infallibility of their Rule, and that they do manifeſtly proceed according to it: and then, in what they are certain that they cannot be miſtaken, they may</hi> (ſaith he<note n="†" place="margin">p. 118, 140. &amp; 166.</note>) <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully decide the controverſies about them, and without raſhneſs propoſe their decrees, as</hi> certain, divine, <hi>Revelations; and excommunicate, anathematize alſo any man perſiſting in the contrary error.</hi> And there ſeems reaſon in ſuch <hi>Anathema;</hi> becauſe all others either do, or may know the truth of the ſame decrees by the ſame certain means, as theſe Governors do. Now then: what certainty the Guides of a particular Church may have, I hope may alſo thoſe of the Church Catholick: and then, obedience being yielded to theſe by all their inferiors, this will reſtore all things to their right courſe. All this follows upon certainty, 1 That Scriptures are plain in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; And 2 that due induſtry is uſed to underſtand them. But, if you ſhould deny, that men can have a <hi>certainty</hi> of their induſtry <hi>rightly uſed;</hi> then again, is all the fair ſecurity theſe men promiſe their followers of their not erring in neceſſaries, quite vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>But now to paſs from this conſequence, (to which I know not what can be ſaid), and to enquire a litle after the true grounds of our certainty in any thing, which is here ſo much pretended.</p>

It cannot be denyed, that he, that doth err in one thing, may be certain, that he doth not err in ſome other; becauſe he may have ſufficient ground, and means for his not erring in one thing, which he hath not in another.

That, in what kind of knowledge ſoever it be (whether of our <hi>ſence,</hi> or <hi>reaſon,</hi> in whatever <hi>Art,</hi> or <hi>Science</hi>) one can never <hi>rightly</hi> aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf concerning his own knowledge, that he is certain of any thing for a <hi>truth,</hi> which all, or moſt others, of the ſame, or better abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for their cognoſcitive faculties, in all the ſame external means, or grounds of the knowledge thereof, do pronounce an <hi>error.</hi> Not, as if truth were not ſo, though all the world oppoſe it; nor had certain grounds to be proved ſo, though all the world ſhould deny
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:179284:190"/>them; but becauſe the true knowledge of it, and them, cannot poſſibly appear to one mans intellect: and, <hi>omnibus paribus,</hi> not to others. Now for any diſparity, as to defect, whether in the <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or in the <hi>means</hi> of knowledge, there, where all, or moſt differ from me, it ſeems a ſtrange pride not to imagine this defect in my ſelf, rather than them; eſpecially, * whenas all the grounds of my Science are communicated to them; and * whenas, for my own miſtakes, I cannot know exactly the extent of ſupernatural delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.

                     <hi>p.</hi> 515. 516.</note> — <hi>The repreſentation of a Church</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, is a thing not ſo evident, from whence it ſhould come: for if ſuch repreſentative of the whole Church there be, it muſt either be ſo by ſome formal act of the Church, or by a tacite conſent. It could not
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:179284:192"/>be by any formal act of the Church; for then there muſt be ſome ſuch act of the univerſal Church preceding the being of any General Council, by which they receive their Commiſsion to appear in behalf of the univerſal Church. Now that the univerſal Church did ever agree in any ſuch act is utterly impoſsible to be demonſtrated, either that it could be, or that it was. But if it be ſaid, that ſuch a formal act is not neceſſary, but the tacite conſent of the whole Church is ſufficient for it; then ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Church muſt be made evident, by which they did devolve over the power of the whole Church to ſuch a</hi> Repreſentative. <hi>And all thoſe muſt conſent in that act, whoſe power the Council pretends to have; of which no footſteps appear</hi>—<hi>The utmoſt then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in this caſe, is, that the parts of the Church may voluntarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to accept of the decrees of ſuch a Council; and, by that voluntary act, or by the ſupreme authority enjoyning it, ſuch decrees may become obligatory.</hi> Thus he.

Though it be ſhewed a lawful General Council, repreſenting the whole Church (as it ought, if ſuch) yet what obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation can there lye upon me of conſenting to it? ſince it may <hi>err</hi> even in <hi>Fundamentals;</hi> if it be not univerſally accepted, as indeed this Council was not, for ſeveral Biſhops there were, that were diſſenters in the Council, and many more afterward.<note n="†" place="margin">See before § 13.</note> 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Were it univerſally accepted; yet unleſs you can ſhew me by ſome means; that this point, wherein I differ from its judgment, is a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, or neceſſary point to ſalvation, both it, and the Catholick Church alſo that accepts it, may err therein. 4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Council ſeems juſtly declinable alſo on this account.

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:179284:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>as alſo was <hi>Arrius</hi> himſelf chiefly by the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s overbearing authority; who, before ſomewhat indifferent in the conteſt, yet, upon <hi>Arrius</hi> his undutiful, and too peremptory letters, had, ſome years before, taken great offence at him; and alſo, (as he was very eloquent) publickly written againſt him<note n="†" place="margin">

By which we may gueſs, that if the Controverſie had at that time been committed to equal, and diſingaged Judges, and ſuch as had not formerly ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a party: or, if the Oriental Biſhops, without any fear of the Prince upon them, might have given free votes, and the <hi>Arrian</hi> cauſe, then had a <hi>Conſtantius</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> (things, wherein Proteſtants well underſtand me, becauſe on the ſame grounds they have rejected the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>) we may preſume, then the iſſue would have been under <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the ſame, that it was under his Succeſſor, I ſay before Judges equal, and indifferent, and not ſuch as were, before, a party, though this party ſhould be compounded of the chief ſuperior Prelates of the Church.

For it is plain on the one ſide, where a Church pretends infallibility, the excommunication is directed againſt the perſons for refuſing to give inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal aſſent to what ſhe defines: But where a Church doth not pretend to that, the excommunication reſpects wholly that overt Act, whereby the Churches peace is broken. And if a Church be bound to look to her own peace, no doubt ſhe hath power to excommunicate ſuch as openly violate the bonds of it; which is only an act of caution in a Church to preſerve her ſelfe in unity; but where it is given out, that the Church is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the excommunication muſt be ſo much the more unreaſonable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is againſt thoſe internal acts of the minde, over which the Church as ſuch, hath no direct power.</hi> — And <hi>p.</hi> 55. he quotes theſe words out of Bp. <hi>Bramhall</hi>
